# customerchurn
Description: 
Predict whether a customer will stop using a product or service based on historical data. This 
project is common in subscription-based industries like telecom, SaaS, and banking. 
Steps: 
1. Data Collection: Use datasets like the Telco Customer Churn Dataset. 
2. Feature Engineering: Process categorical variables (e.g., payment method, contract 
type), handle missing values, and create derived features (e.g., tenure in months). 
3. Model Building: Train a classification model like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, 
or XGBoost to predict churn (yes/no). 
4. Evaluation: Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and the ROC curve to evaluate 
the model. 
5. Interpretation: Use SHAP or LIME to explain important features contributing to churn.
